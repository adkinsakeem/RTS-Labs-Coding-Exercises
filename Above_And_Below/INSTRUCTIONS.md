# Above_And_Below


### For Question 1, the problem was: 
Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.


* The Above_And_Below.java file is the file that should be submitted for this problem. 
* In the Values_For_Above_And_Below class, the “Array_2_InitValue_Check” function should be called from a “main” function. 
* The two values that should be passed are the input value, which is an integer, and an array value that has an array of integers. 
* The Values_For_Above_And_Below.java file calls the “Array_2_InitValue_Check” function in the “Above_And_Below” class.
