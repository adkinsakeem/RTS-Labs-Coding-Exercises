# Rotate_The_Characters


### For Question 2, the problem was: 
Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.


* The Rotate_The_Characters.java file is the file that should be submitted for this problem. 
* In the Values_For_Rotate_The_Characters class, the “rotate_Characters_Forward” function should be called from a “main” function (There is also a function located in this class called rotate_Characters_Backward which rotates the string in the opposite direction). 
* The two values that should be passed are the rotate_Num value, which is an integer, and the inputString value, which is a string. 
* The Values_For_Rotate_Characters_Forward.java file calls the “rotate_Characters_Forward” function in the “Rotate_The_Characters” class.
